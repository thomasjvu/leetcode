## **Optimizations**

I consistently refactor and optimize my code for both efficiency and readability.

#### **Lessons Learned**

The biggest lesson I learn while doing LeetCode is that there is always something new to learn. Even if I don't know the answer right away, I research the MDN until I can solve it. 

## **Other Works**
If you're interested, take a look at a couple other projects that I have in my portfolio!
