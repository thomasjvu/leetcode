-- Solution
SELECT
    date_id,
    make_name
    COUNT(DISTINCT(lead_id)) as unique_leads
    COUNT(DISTINCT(partner_id)) as unique_partners
FROM DailySales
GROUP BY date_id, make_name

-- Explanation
-- Use the COUNT(DISTINCT()) statement to get the unique number of leads and partners from each column (checking if the IDs are the same)
-- We can GROUP BY multiple columns by separating them with a comma, which will give us the total unique_leads and unique_partners for each date and car make
