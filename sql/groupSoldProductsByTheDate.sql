-- LeetCode #1484. Group Sold Products By The Date
/* Instructions
Table Activities:

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

 

Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product     |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
Explanation: 
For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

-- Solution
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) as num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product) as products 
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
ORDER BY sell_date

-- Explanation
-- Use the SELECT statement to get the sell_date column
-- Use the COUNT(DISTINCT) statement to count each distinct product as num_sold
-- Use the GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT) statement to concatenate the values of a specified column into a single string as products
-- Use the GROUP BY function to group the products by sell_date
-- Use the ORDER BY function to sort the items by sell_date in ascending order
