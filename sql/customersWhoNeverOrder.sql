SQL Schema

Table: Customers

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.

 

Table: Orders

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.

 

Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

-- Solution
SELECT name AS Customers FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON Customers.id = Orders.customerId
WHERE Orders.id IS NULL

-- Explanation
-- Use the SELECT keyword to select the column name
-- Use the AS keyword to change the column name to Customers
-- Use the FROM keyword to grab data from the table Customers
-- Use the LEFT JOIN keyword to join the Customers.id column with the Orders.customerId column
-- Use the WHERE..IS NULL conditional to return only the customer names where the Orders.id is equal to null
