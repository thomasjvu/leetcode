-- Solution
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 or b.bonus IS NULL

-- Explanation
-- SELECT name from the Employee table and bonus from the Bonus table
-- We want to use a LEFT JOIN to join the table at the same column (empId)
-- We want to get values WHERE the bonus is less than 1000 or null
