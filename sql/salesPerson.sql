Explanation: 
According to orders 3 and 4 in the Orders table, it is easy to tell that only salesperson John and Pam have sales to company RED, so we report all the other names in the table salesperson.


*/

-- Answer
SELECT s.name
FROM SalesPerson s
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN Company c ON o.com_id = c.com_id
    WHERE o.sales_id = s.sales_id AND c.name = 'RED'
)

-- Explanation
-- SELECT the name column FROM the SalesPerson table
-- WHERE NOT EXISTS checks whether a condition is NOT TRUE (the subquery returns true if there is no order related to the company with the name "RED" for the salesperson)
-- SELECT 1 specifies the value that the subquery will return if true
-- Subquery is getting data FROM Orders table
-- JOIN the Company Table to the Orders table using the com_id column to filter orders based on the name of the company
-- WHERE checks if the sales_id is equal and a company name of red.
-- This returns the names of all people where the subquery returns false, which means they did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED"
