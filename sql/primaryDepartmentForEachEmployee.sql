-- LeetCode #1789. Primary Department for Each Employee
/* Instructions
Table: Employee

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   |  Type   |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| department_id | int     |
| primary_flag  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for this table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

 

Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other departments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Note that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is 'N'.

Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
- The Primary department for employee 1 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 2 is 1.
- The Primary department for employee 3 is 3.
- The Primary department for employee 4 is 3.

-- Solution
SELECT employee_id, ABS(MAX(IF(primary_flag = 'Y', department_id, -department_id))) AS department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id

-- Explanation
-- Select the employee_id column, and the department_id column by checking if the primary_flag is Y, then department_id is selected as is, but if it is 'N', it selects the negation of the department_id value. By negating the values for departments that are not primary, we ensure that the maximum value returned will be the primary department if there is one, or the only department if the employee belongs to only one department. The ABS() function is applied to get rid of the negative sign.
-- FROM the Employee table
-- and GROUP BY the employee_id, so that each employee_id has 1 department_id associated with it
